# Protecting-Women-from-Safety-Threats-Using-Computer-Vision

## Problem Statement-
This project aims to address the issue of women's safety in urban environments by utilizing advanced deep learning and computer vision models to detect potential safety threats in real-time. The solution leverages CCTV footage to detect and analyze safety threats such as violence, the presence of multiple men near a lone woman, suspicious activity, and more, ensuring timely alerts for prevention and intervention.

## SIH Hackathon-
This project was initiated as part of the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), where the focus was on developing technology-driven solutions for women’s safety. The proposed solution aims to improve real-time threat detection using AI and alert systems integrated into a CCTV framework.

The architecture of this project consists of multiple modules for detecting persons, analyzing gender ratios, detecting emotions, and generating SOS alerts when necessary. The system leverages:

##### •YOLOv8 for real-time person detection.
##### •MediaPipe for pose and facial expression detection.
##### •Transformers for gender detection.
##### •MobileNet for violence detection.
##### •DBSCAN and GRU for hotspot analysis.
### Technical Approach -
1. Person Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting individuals in CCTV footage and tracking them across frames.
2. Gender Detection: Based on Transformer models, it identifies gender to detect if a woman is surrounded by multiple men.
3. Emotion and Pose Detection: Uses MediaPipe for facial emotion detection (like fear or distress) and body pose classification (running, walking, standing).
4. Violence Detection: MobileNet-based model for identifying violent activity such as fights or physical altercations.
5. Hotspot Detection: Using DBSCAN and GRU, the model detects locations with repeated instances of potential danger, identifying unsafe zones or "hotspots."
